title: AAAA Comparing ML models for single-label text classification

## Problem statement, goals and success criteria

Text Classification techniques are necessary to find relevant information in many different tasks that deal with large quantities of information in text form.  Some of the most common tasks where these techniques are applied include: finding answers to similar questions that have been answered before; classifying news by subject or newsgroup; sorting spam from legitimate e-mail messages; finding web pages on a given subject, among others. In each case, the goal is to assign the appropriate class or label to each document that needs to be classified. 

Depending on the application, documents can be classified into one or more classes.  For instance, a piece of news regarding how the Prime Minister spent his holidays may be classified both as politics and in the social column.  In other situations, however, documents can have only one classification, for example, when distinguishing between spam and legitimate e-mail messages.  The focus of this work is where each document belongs to a single class, that is, single-label classification.
